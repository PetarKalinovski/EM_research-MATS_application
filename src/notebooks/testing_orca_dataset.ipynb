But, in a three part-series about clauses buried in tens of millions of contracts, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Michael Corkery (along with another reporter, Robert Gebeloff) reported on the way these clauses have deprived Americans of one of their most fundamental constitutional rights: their day in court.\\n\\nRead by millions, the series shows how arbitration clauses contained in most contracts — like employment, telephone service, credit cards — have crept into nearly every corner of Americans’ lives.\\n\\nEngineered by a Wall Street-led coalition of credit card companies and retailers, arbitration blocks class-action lawsuits and so insulates businesses from challenges to practices like predatory lending, wage theft and discrimination. Not surprisingly the rules of arbitration create an alternate system of privatized justice that largely favors the business interests. This is not good news for consumers.\\n\\nIn this podcast, Ms. Silver-Greenberg and Mr. Corkery talk about spending months sifting through court documents and interviewing hundreds of lawyers, corporate executives, judges, arbitrators and plaintiffs in 35 states.\\n\\nSusan Lehman is the host.\\n\\nTitle:',\n",
